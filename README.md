# SERENITY
Daedarus' Hacks

## Inspiration
Mental health has become a serious concern around the world. Also, in today's era mental health services are few and expensive.  So we hereby present- Serenity, an easy-to-use platform with some amazing features that will help people to overcome mental stress and their low moments.

## What it does
Serenity is the one-stop solution for mental health issues. It provides a variety of mental health resources, a meditation/music player, a positive affirmation generator with the function of recording affirmations in your voice, and an audio diary that types out a journal for you by listening to your words.

## How we built it
We built it using html5, css3, javascript, and bootstrap on repl.it.

## Challenges we ran into
Adding an embedded audio player, using speech-to-text recognition features in the website were definitely some of the challenges we ran into while building the website.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our ability to work as a team and implementing everything we wanted to add to the website and getting the final beautiful result are the things that we are most proud of.

## What we learned
We learned a number of new properties of tech stacks that we used and those will undoubtedly be useful in the future.

## What's next for Serenity
We hope to add more features to the website in the future like connecting with other people and sharing the success story of how certain people have overcome their mental problems so that more people can get inspiration from them and do not hesitate to work on their own shelves.
